# Full Stack Udacity Capstone API Backend

## Getting Started

### Installing Dependencies

#### Python 3.7
In order for current dependecies to work please use python 3.7 

Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

#### Virtual Enviornment

We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organaized. Instructions for setting up a virual enviornment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

#### PIP Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by naviging to the `/backend` directory and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages we selected within the `requirements.txt` file.

##### Key Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)  is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM we'll use handle the lightweight sqlite database. You'll primarily work in app.py and can reference models.py. 

- [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is the extension we'll use to handle cross origin requests from our frontend server. 


## Running the server

From within the `backend` directory first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

To run the server, execute:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=app.py
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```

Setting the `FLASK_ENV` variable to `development` will detect file changes and restart the server automatically.

Setting the `FLASK_APP` variable to `app.py`

## Testing
test_app.py is included in order to run a unittest please use the following commands to successfully run the test
```
dropdb agency_test
createdb agency_test
python test_app.py
```
## Testing Postman
A postman collection is also included in order to facilitate testing of endpoints there are three folders one for each profile and an individual 
endpoint named GET TOKEN which takes in a json with a key of client and value of the RBAC profile as a string
by default the token is set to retrieve the executive producer token.
Host and jwt tokens are set as variables please go to collection settings if you need to change something like a expired jwt
Collection will be uploaded with a 24 hour jwt for reviewers to use, if by some reason the token expires please use the provided token endpoint to renew your jwt token for each RBAC profile
